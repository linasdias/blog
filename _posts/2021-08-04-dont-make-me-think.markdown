hi again!
while i was translating 'the design of everyday things' i got a little distracted and read 'don't make me think' simultaneously, which messed up my posting schedule, so i'm posting both highlights at the same time.
hope you like it!

## guiding principles
- "the most important thing i should do if i want to make sure my site or app is easy to use is 'don't make me think!'. your work should be self-evident."

- "the most important thing you can do is to understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks. when you do, you'll begin to notice all the things that make you think in the sites and apps you use. and eventually you'll learn to recognize and avoid them in the things you're building."

- "your goal should be for each page or screen to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user will know what it is and how to use it. in other words, they'll 'get it' without having to think about it. here's the rule: if you can't make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory."

- "why us all of this so important? it's true that there's a lot of competition out there. but it'd not always true that people are fickle: they may have no choice but to stick with it; you'd be surprised at how long some people will tough it out on sites that frustrate them, often blaming themselves and not the site; besides, who's to say that the competition will be any less frustrating?"

- "making every page or screen self-evident is like having a good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better."

- "when we're creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading all of our carefully crafted text, et cetera, and what they actually do most of the time (if we're lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some text, and click on the first link that catches their interest."

- "why do we scan: (1) we're usually on a mission; (2) we know we don't need to read everything; (3) we're good at it."

- "when we're designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan the page, consider all the available options, and choose the best one. in reality, though, most of the time we don't choose the best option -- we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing. as soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we're looking for, there's a very good chance that we'll click it."

- "so why don't Web users look for the best choice? (1) we're usually in a hurry; (2) there's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong; (3) weighing options may not improve our chances; (4) guessing is more fun."

- "we don't figure out how things work, we muddle through: why does this happen? (1) it's not important to us; (2) if we find something that works, we stick to it."

- "if users 'get it': (1) there's a much better chance that they'll find what they're looking for, which is good for them and for you; (2) there's a better chance that they'll understand the full range of what your site has to offer -- not just the parts that they stumble across; (3) you have a better chance of steering them to the parts of your site that you want them to see; (4) they'll feel smarter and more in control when they're using your site, which will bring them back."

- "on the face of it, 'number of clicks to get anywhere' seems like a useful metric. but over time i've come to think that what really counts is not the number of clicks it takes me to get to what I want (although there are limits), but rather how hard each click is -- the amount of thought required and the amount of uncertainty about whether i'm making the right choice."

## things you need to get right
- "it's a fact: people won't use your website if they can't find their way around it."

- "two of the purposes of navigation are fairly obvious: to help us find whatever it is we're looking for and to tell us where we are. but navigation has some other equally important -- and easily overlooked functions: it tells us what's here, how to use the site and it gives us confidence in the people who built it."

## making sure you got them right
- "while the hype culture (upper management, marketing, and business development) is focused on making whatever promises are necessary to attract venture capital, revenue-generating deals, and users to the site, the burden of delivering on those promises lands on the shoulders of the craft culture artisans like the designers and developers. this modern high-tech version of the perennial struggle between art and commerce adds another level of complexity to any discussions of usability issues -- often in the form of apparently arbitrary edicts handed down from the hype side of the fence."

- "the point is, it's not productive to ask questions like 'do most people like pull-down menus?' the right kind of question to ask is 'does this pull-down, with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?'"

- "focus ruthlessly on fixing the most serious problems first: make a collective list; choose the ten most serious problems; rate them; create an ordered list. when you feel like you've allocated all the time and resources you have available in the next month for fixing usability problems, stop. you've got what you came for. the group has now decided what needs to be fixed and made a commitment to fixing it."

## larger concerns and outside influences
- "managing real estate challenges shouldn't be done at the cost of usability."

- "the truth is, it's a lot harder than it ought to be to make a site accessible. after all, most designers and developers are not going to become accessibility experts. if web accessibility is going to become ubiquitous, it's going to have to be easier to do. screen readers and other adaptive technologies have to get smarter, the tools for building sites have to make it easier to code correctly for accessibility, and our design processes need to be updated to include thinking about accessibility from the beginning."
