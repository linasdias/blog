hello again! nice to see you here one more time.

these days in vacation had me feeling very unmotivated and tired, so i went to the mall searching for some in-person buying experience. i had nothing in mind, really, until i saw 'the design of everyday things' (*ptbr:* o design do dia a dia) for 50 reais at the book shop and had to buy it. i've been reading about ux for almost a year, but i couldn't bring myself to finish the pdf, english version of this book that is occupying some space in my laptop. i learned that i'm a physical reader: i have to feel the pages being passed to feel that i've actually read something. the only exception was 'the rise and reign of the unruly women' by anne helen petersen... but it was still april 2020, i wasn't *that* burned out yet!

in this post, i'll be listing my main highlights and takeaways from 'the design of everyday things', just for keeping it in a safe place and hoping that it could be useful for anyone. keep in mind that this won't be from the english version -- i'm going to (re?) translate them from the brazilian portuguese version that i bought and *actually* finished reading.

## preface
- "the problems may seem trivial, but can mean the difference between pleasure and frustration. the same principles that do these simple things work or not, also apply to more complex operations, including those which human lives depend on. most accidents are attributed to human error, but in almost all, the 'human error' was a direct outcome of the bad quality of the design. the principles that guide a quality, human-centered design, aren't just relevant to a more pleasant life -- they can save lives."

- "to comprehend how to use stuff, we need conceptual models of how they work. these models make very different behaviors easy when we're at home and in the car. a good conceptual model can make the difference between successful and wrong operation of many devices in our life."

- "the good design is also an act of communication between the designer and the user, except for every communication needs to be done through the appearance of the own device, that should be self-explanatory."

- "in design, it's important to show the effect of an action. without feedback, we want to know if something happened. maybe the button hasn't been pressed strongly enough; maybe the machine has stopped working; maybe you're doing the wrong thing."

- "the safest way to make something usable, with a few errors, it's to make it impossible to make it otherwise. the practical rule that the experience taught says: when it's necessary for the instructions to be glued to anything, the design is bad."

- "affordances -- a good designer is always sure that the proper actions are visible and the improper, invisible. the environment affordances are what it offers to the animal, that which the ambient gives or haves, be it for the good, be it for the bad. i mean, something that refers, at the same time, to the ambient and the animal, in a way that any existent term does. it implies the complementarity of the animal and the ambient."

- "proper and human-centered design required that every consideration is addressed since the beginning, with which of the design relevant subject working together as a team. most of the design aims to be used by people, in a way that their necessities and exigences should constitute the strength that impulses a big part of the work during the whole process."

## chapter 1: the psychopathology of everyday things
- "why do we tolerate the frustration of everyday objects, with things that we can't discover how to use, that turned out too confusing to be used, that on ads affirm to make everything, but that make it impossible to do anything?"

- "the user needs help. only the right things have to be visible to indicate which parts should be operated and how, to indicate how the user should interact with the device. visibility indicates the mapping between intended actions and concrete operations. visibility indicates crucial distinctions, so that you can distinguish between the salt and pepper container, for example. and the visibility of the effects of operations tells you if the lights have been properly turned on, if the projection screen has been lowered up to the correct height or if the refrigerator's temperature is set correctly. it's the lack of visibility that makes so many computer-controlled devices so difficult to operate. and it's an excess of visibility that makes the stereo or VCR clogged devices and overloaded with apps so intimidating."

- "the fundamental principles of designing design for people are (1) providing a good conceptual model and (2) making things visible."

- "a good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our actions. without a good conceptual model we operate blindly; we do operations as we are told to do them; we cannot fully assess why, what effects to expect, or what to do if things go wrong. as long as things work properly, we can get by. however, when they don't work out or when we are faced with a new situation, we need to have a deeper understanding of how they work, we need a good model."

- "visibility acts as a good reminder of what can be done and allows the control to specify how the action should be performed. the good relationship between the placement of the control and what it does makes it easy to find the appropriate control for a task. as a result, there is very little that needs to be remembered."

- "mapping is a technical term meaning the relationship between two things, in this case between controls and their movements and the results in the world. mapping is easily learned and always remembered. natural mapping means making use of physical analogies and cultural patterns, and leads to immediate understanding."

- "the paradox of technology should never be used as an excuse for bad design. it's true that as the number of options and capabilities of any device increases, so must the number and complexity of controls. but good design principles can make complexity manageable, easy to deal with."

## chapter 2: the psychology of everyday actions
- "of course people do make mistakes. complex equipment requires some instructions, and someone using them without instructions should expect to make mistakes and to be confused. but designers should put extra effort into making mistakes as cost-free as possible. errors should be easy to detect, have minimal consequences and, if possible, their effects should be reversible."

- "in the absence of outside information, people are free to let their imaginations run wild, as long as the mental models they develop relate to facts as they perceive them."

- "a very important aspect of assigning blame is that we often have little information to rely on to make a judgement, and what little information we have may be wrong. as a result, blame or credit can be determined almost independently of reality. this is where the apparent simplicity of everyday objects causes problems."

- "the phenomenon called learned (or assimilated) helplessness can explain the attribution of blame to oneself. it refers to the situation in which people go through the experience of failing to fulfill a task numerous times. it can be performed, at least not by them: they are incapable, helpless. the phenomenon has most often been studied as a precursor to the clinical problem of depression, but it could easily arise with some bad experiences with everyday objects."

- "do common phobias in relation to technology and mathematics result from a type of learned or assimilated helplessness? could some cases of failure, in situations that appear to be simple and objective, become generalized, so as to encompass every technological object , any mathematical problem? perhaps. in fact, the design project of everyday objects seems almost determined to cause this. we might call this phenomenon taught helplessness. with ill-conceived and poorly-designed objects -- constructed in a mis-inducing manner. misunderstood, erroneous mental models and low level of feedback, it's no wonder people feel guilty when they have difficulty using objects, especially when they realize (incorrectly) that no one else is having the same problems."

- "seven stages of action; one for goal, three for execution and three for evaluation: (1) formalize the goal, (2) formalize the intention, (3) specify the action, (4) perform the action, (5) having a perception of the state of the world, (6) interpreting the state of the world and (7) evaluating the result."

## chapter 3: knowledge in the head and in the world
- "appropriate behavior can emerge from inaccurate knowledge for four reasons: (1) the information is in the world, (2) great precision is not required, (3) natural restrictions are present, and (4) cultural restrictions are present. "

- "people function through the use of two types of knowledge: knowing 'what' and knowing 'how'. knowing 'what' -- which psychologists call declarative knowledge -- includes knowledge of facts and rules, like 'stop at the red light'. declarative knowledge is easy to write down and teach. 'how' knowing -- what psychologists call procedural knowledge -- is knowledge that allows a person to move their tongue correctly while saying 'frightening witches', for example. procedural knowledge is difficult or nearly impossible to write and complicated to teach. it is best taught through demonstration, and best learned through practice, and is mostly subconscious."

- "human memory is essentially knowledge in the head or inner knowledge. if we look at how people use memory and how they retrieve information, we discover a variety of categories. three are important to us now: (1) memory for arbitrary things , (2) memory for meaningful relationships and (3) memory through explanation."

- "knowledge (or information) in the world and in the head are essential for our daily functioning. but, to some extent, we can choose to learn one or the other more seriously. the choice requires an asymmetric exchange -- acquiring the advantages of knowledge in the world means lose the advantages of knowledge in the head."

- "for knowledge in the world, the ability to retrieve information is present whenever it is visible or audible. learning is not necessary, as it is replaced by interpretation. the ease of interpreting information depends on the way in which natural mappings are explored and coercions. efficiency of use tends to be slowed by the need to find and interpret external information. ease of use on first contact is high, and it can be ugly and inelegant, especially if there is a need to keep a lot of information, which can lead to cluttering. basically, the aesthetic appeal depends on the talent of the designer."

- "for knowledge in the head, information is not easily retrievable, requiring memory research or something that makes it remembered. this knowledge requires learning that can be considerable. it can be facilitated if its meaning was naturally grasped or if there is one good mental model. its use can be quite efficient, the ease of use on the first contact is low and, in relation to aesthetics, nothing needs to be visible, which gives the designer more freedom. this, in turn, can lead to better aesthetics."

## chapter 4: knowing what to do
- "the difficulty of dealing with new situations is directly related to the number of possibilities. the user considers the situation and tries to discover the parts of the components that can be operated and the operations that can be performed. problems occur whenever there is more than one possibility. if there is a single component part that can be operated and only one possible action to perform, there will be no difficulty. of course, if the designer has hidden all visible indications, the consumer may believe that there aren't alternatives and won't even know how to start."

- "physical constraints restrict the possible operations. the value of physical constraints is that they rely on the properties of the physical world for their operation; no special training is required. with the proper use of physical constraints, there should have only a limited number of possible actions, or at least the desired actions can be made obvious, in general by being especially evident. on the other hand, physical constraints prevent the wrong action from working only after she was tempted."

- "semantic constraints rely on the meaning of the situation to control the set of possible actions. in the case of the motorcycle, there is only one meaningful location for the driver, who has to be seated facing forward. the purpose of the windshield is to protect the driver's face, so he needs to be in front of the driver. semantic constraints rely on our knowledge of the situation and the world, which can be an important and powerful indication."

- "some restrictions rely on accepted cultural conventions, even if these do not affect the physical or semantic operation of the artifact. a cultural convention is that signals are meant to be read. each culture has a set of permissible actions for social situations."

- "if we want sounds to be useful, they must be intelligently generated, with an understanding and knowledge of the natural relationship between the sounds and the information to be conveyed. the sounds produced by artificial artifacts should be as useful as the sounds in the real world."

- "just as the presence of sound can play a useful role in providing feedback about events, the absence of sound can result in the same kinds of difficulties we've encountered due to lack of feedback. absence of sound can mean lack of information, and when the feedback of an action is expected to come from the sound, silence can result in problems."

## chapter 5: to err is human
- "errors can take many forms. two fundamental categories are lapses and mistakes. lapses result from automatic behavior, when subconscious actions intended to satisfy our goals are stopped halfway. mistakes result from conscious deliberation. the same process that makes us creative and perceptive, allowing us to see relationships between seemingly unrelated things and to reach correct conclusions based on partial or even imperfect indications, also misleads us. false generalizations can be hard to discover and much more to eliminate."

- "mistakes result from choosing inappropriate goals or objectives. a person makes an inappropriate decision, misclassifies a situation, or fails to consider all the relevant factors. many errors of this kind stem from the vagaries of human thinking, often because people tend to rely on and rely on experiences already lived and remembered, rather than relying on more systematic analysis. we make decisions based on what is in our memory; it is distorted and partial, and tends to over-generalize and regularize what is banal and commonplace, and overemphasizing what is out of line."

- "a list of what designers and designers should do: (1) understand the causes of error and conceive and design the design to minimize them; (2) make it possible to reverse actions or make it more difficult to do what cannot be reversed; (3) make it easier to discover the errors that actually occur, make them easier to correct; (4) change your attitude towards errors. think of the user of an object as someone trying to perform a task and getting there through of imperfect approximations. do not think of the user as someone who makes mistakes, think of actions as approximations of what is desired."

- "there are many ways for a designer to deal with errors. what is critical, however, is to approach the topic with an appropriate philosophy. the designer should not think of a simple dichotomy between errors and correct behavior; instead, the entire interaction should be treated as a cooperative effort between person and machine, an effort in which misunderstandings can occur on both sides."

- "(1) put knowledge in the world. not require all knowledge to be in the head; (2) use the force of natural and artificial constraints: physical, logical, semantic and cultural; (3) narrow the gaps in execution and evaluation. make things visible for both execution and evaluation."

## chapter 6: the design challenge
- "if everyday design was ruled by aesthetics, life might be more pleasing to the eye but less comfortable; if it were ruled by usability, it might be more comfortable but would be also uglier. if cost and ease of manufacture had the upper hand, the products might not be attractive, nor functional, nor durable. unquestionably, each of these considerations has its place. the problem occurs when one takes precedence over all others."

- "the average or standard person does not exist. this creates a problem for the designer, who usually has to conceive a single design for everyone; the task is difficult when all kinds of people are expected to use the object. one solution is to make everything adjustable."

- "if it is not possible to put the knowledge in the artifact or device, create a cultural coercion: standardize what has to be kept in the head."

- "there are three requirements for a system to be exploitable: (1) in each state of the system, the user must readily see and be able to do all permissible actions; (2) the effect of each action must at the same time , be visible and easy to interpret; (3) actions should not entail cost."

## chapter 7: user-centered design
- "the design must: (1) make it easy to determine the possible actions at any time; (2) make things visible, including the conceptual model of the system, the optional actions, and the results of actions; (3) make it easy to assess the current state of the system; (4) follow natural mappings between intentions and required actions, between actions and the resulting effect, and between visible information and interpretation of system state."

- "how the designer will accomplish this task: (1) use knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head at the same time; (2) simplify the structure of tasks; (3) make things visible, ensure that the execution gaps and evaluation are shortened or surpassed; (4) do the mappings correctly; (5) explore the power of natural and artificial constraints; (6) design for error; (7) when all else fails, standardize."

- "people learn better and feel more comfortable when the knowledge required to perform a task is available externally, but knowledge in the world is only useful if there is a natural, easily interpretable relationship between that knowledge and the information he intends to convey about possible actions and outcomes."
